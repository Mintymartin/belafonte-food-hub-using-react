## Project Description
Using a JSON server I came up with a list of meals that are available on a website: Belafonte Food Hub website that offers users a variety of meals where one can scroll and learn how tocook the meal and add their own meal in the website

Getting:
1.List of meals/dish.
2.Name of the meal.
3.Category: such as Soup or side dish.
4.Origin of the meal.
5.Add your meal
